# Quantumize Blog App

Quantumize is a modern blog application built using Next.js, Firebase, and Prisma. It allows you to create, read, and manage blog posts, discover popular categories, and interact with a community of readers and writers.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign in using their Google or GitHub accounts to create, edit, and comment on blog posts.

- **Blog Posts**: Create, read, and manage blog posts with support for rich text, images, and comments.

- **Categories**: Discover popular blog categories, each with its unique content.

- **Dark Mode**: Customize your reading experience with a built-in dark mode.
